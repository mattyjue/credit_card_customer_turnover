# credit_card_customer_turnover

#  Overview
Machine learning model to predict credit card customer turnover. Did some EDA and built a preprocessing pipeline to standardize the data and address class imbalance and categorical variables. I ran a Random Forest model, logistic regression classification model, a KNN model, and an XGB classifier model. The Random forest model had the best results with 89% accurracy.
